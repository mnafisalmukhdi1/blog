Speech impediment<br>
It's just feel like stuck in the basement<br>
Why it's so hurt to myself<br>
I just me, think about yourself<br>
<br>
Growing up they say<br>
Asking every question, I may<br>
Who are me in the day?<br>
I can't even go to the bay<br>
<br>
Friends? Why are you asking?<br>
You weren't accept me, until I am king<br>
Separated by destiny<br>
The faith of enemy<br>
<br>
Now I'm here, standing strong<br>
I hope everyting will go, don't wrong<br>
You find me as who?<br>
Keep that in mind and don't change, oh you
